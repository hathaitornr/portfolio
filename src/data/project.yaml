      content: "We live in a rapidly aging society. Currently, around 1 million Americans live in some type of senior care facility, and that number is expected to double by the year of 2030. As a result, hospitals and senior care facilities will face a tremendous challenge in providing the proper care to all these patients. In this project, my team and I explored the possibility of utilizing emerging technology to help these care facilities provide better care for their elderly patients. On a related note, many tech companies have already been working to create applications and software for hospitals to improve their workflow and help provide better care for patients. However, many of these applications fail because of a lack of understanding of the hospital workflow and the target users. For example, in such a fast-paced environment where patient lives are the priority, many healthcare professionals simply do not have the time to transition to a new system. Furthermore, healthcare workers already incorporate so many other resources to record patient data, take notes, view test results, etc. Introducing another tool would inevitably lead to more complexity in their operations. In addition, many healthcare workers and patients, may not even have the same level of technical experience as those in the tech industry, which may prove a hindrance in operating any potential systems. So, even if a new application was made to help care facilities provide better care for their elderly patients, it is bound to fail if it does not consider how the current system works and the level of technical prowess of its target users."
