            I am currently a Design Researcher at Scholastic Inc., where I conduct research on parents and teachers to
            better serve Scholastic‚Äôs customers in children education.

            With a background in HCI and data science, I‚Äôm well-versed in both Qualitative and Quantitative aspects of
            user research. And with experience working in multi-disciplinary teams, and as a former engineer myself, I know
